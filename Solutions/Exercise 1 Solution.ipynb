    "**Task 2** A training provider has 10 centres, each with 1000 students that have taken an assessment.  Randomly generate scores for each student in each centre, which should be represented in a NumPy array.  Each score should be between 0 and 1, representing a percentage achieved on the assessment.  Then calculate the mean score achieved by students at each centre.  Once calculated, the means should be converted into percentages (ie from values between 0 and 1 to values between 0 and 100) which you should store as a NumPy array, and then rounded to 2 decimal places, which you should overwrite in THE SAME array of percentages.  Finally, print the rounded percentage scores for each centre.\n",

You could also check the NumPy documentation here : https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html (though be warned, it's extensive!)"
